## **The Origin of MF Stack**

I recently obtained my ARN license and got empaneled with a few AMCs. As a newcomer to the Mutual Funds Distribution market, I wasn’t entirely sure what to do next. While several white-labeled systems and third-party platforms exist for onboarding investors and processing transactions, choosing the right one required careful consideration. After exploring my options, I identified two key factors that influenced my decision:

- **Selecting the right backend transaction engine.**
- **Finding an affordable platform with essential features**, especially as a new ARN holder with zero AUM.

MF Stack was built to address these challenges, offering a seamless onboarding experience for Mutual Fund distributors, IFAs, fintechs, and AMCs. It enables ARN holders to start distributing Mutual Funds with a cost-effective and feature-rich platform.
